## Description

CVE-2023-1874 is a vulnerability in the WP Data Access plugin versions 5.3.7 and earlier. An attacker can supply the `wpda_role[]` option when updating a profile to escalate privileges.

From NIST:

```
The WP Data Access plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 5.3.7. This is due to a lack of authorization checks on the multiple_roles_update function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to modify their user role by supplying the 'wpda_role[]' parameter during a profile update. This requires the 'Enable role management' setting to be enabled for the site.
```
